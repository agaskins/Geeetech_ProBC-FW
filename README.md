## IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR THIS GEEETECH VERSION OF MARLIN:
I have made some minor changes to the RCBugFix branch of Marlin with two objectives in mind:
- Making it work well with Geeetech Pro B and Pro C models with minimal editing required (although minor, the changes involved can be complicated for many users).
- Making the Pro B/C a more cutting-edge printer by enabling many features not enabled in Marlin or the stock Geeetech FW.

Also, I try to document my changes as best I can, especially if it might not be obvious why I did something, or if it's very different than the defaults. I would say under normal circumstances it's over-commenting, but I want to make this easy for anyone who isn't a coder, or is not at all familiar with Marlin to understand what I do and why. Most of my comments include the words 'Geeetech' and/or 'ProB/C'. It's pretty consistant, but I will improve consistancy even more soon.

Oh, and this might also be a good starting point if you use any other Geeetech GT2560 based printer, so I'd be excited to hear from you if this helps with any printers besides the Pro B/C! I'd even be willing to make this more general and call it the 'GT2560 Marlin' or something if it turns out there's more people than benefit from this!

And finally, anyone is welcome to contribute, comment, make requests, etc. I am pretty new to doing real work on Github, so if you're a Github veteran and notice something I'm doing that seems... well, wrong or stupid, by all means let me know! I'm using Github and not just releasing zip files on the Geeetech forum because I want to do this right and be as transparent and community-minded as possible. Let's make these printers better together! :)

## Features not in the stock Geeetech firmware:
- Baby-stepping - allows you to finely adjust your Z axis height after the print starts (double press the rotary encoder while on the home screen).
- Linear Advance - This exciting new feature is enabled in this firmware but NOT active by default. This is because it takes some understanding to use, and you will need to make specific settings in your slicer to print with this feature. See: <http://marlinfw.org/docs/features/lin_advance.html>
- And much more that I will document here ASAP! Most of these features are enabled in Configuration_adv.h, if you are curious.

## Marlin 1.1

Marlin 1.1 represents an evolutionary leap over Marlin 1.0.2. It is the result of over two years of effort by several volunteers around the world who have paid meticulous and sometimes obsessive attention to every detail. For this release we focused on code quality, performance, stability, and overall user experience. Several new features have also been added, many of which require no extra hardware.

For complete Marlin documentation click over to the [Marlin Homepage <marlinfw.org>](http://marlinfw.org/), where you will find in-depth articles, how-to videos, and tutorials on every aspect of Marlin, as the site develops. For release notes, see the [Releases](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases) page.

## Stable Release Branch

This Release branch contains the latest tagged version of Marlin (currently 1.1.2 – May 2017).

Previous releases of Marlin include [1.0.2-2](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/1.0.2-2) (December 2016) and [1.0.1](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/1.0.1) (December 2014). Any version of Marlin prior to 1.0.1 (when we started tagging versions) can be collectively referred to as Marlin 1.0.0.

## Contributing to Marlin

Click on the [Issue Queue](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/pulls) links above at any time to see what we're currently working on.

To submit patches and new features for Marlin 1.1 check out the [bugfix-1.1.x](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/bugfix-1.1.x) branch, add your commits, and submit a Pull Request back to the `bugfix-1.1.x` branch. Periodically that branch will form the basis for the next minor release.

Note that our "bugfix" branch will always contain the latest patches to the current release version. These patches may not be widely tested. As always, when using "nightly" builds of Marlin, proceed with full caution.

## Current Status: In Development

Marlin development has reached an important milestone with its first stable release in over 2 years. During this period we focused on cleaning up the code and making it more modern, consistent, readable, and sensible.

## Future Development

Marlin 1.1 is the last "flat" version of Marlin!

Arduino IDE now has support for folder hierarchies, so Marlin 1.2 will have a [hierarchical file structure](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/breakup-marlin-idea). Marlin's newly reorganized code will be easier to work with and form a stronger starting-point as we get into [32-bit CPU support](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/32-Bit-RCBugFix-new) and the Hardware Access Layer (HAL).

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](https://github.com/COPYING.md) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
